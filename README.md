# AgilityCMS Angular 18 SSR Starter
This repository is a template you can use to render your AgilityCMS website on Angular 18. 

**Prerequesites**
Node v20+ 

**Installation**
Clone this Repository
`npm install` to install the the required packages.

**Environmental Variables**
You will need to get the following from the Agility Manager;
`GUID` `API_PREVIEW_KEY` `API_FETCH_KEY` `LOCALE` `SITEMAP`

https://manager.agilitycms.com/settings/apikeys

You will need to populate an `.env` file in the root of your project as follows.

This will use `dotenv.config.json` to write your `environment.ts` and `environment.prod.ts` files required by Angular. This approach avoids exposing your API keys to your Git repository.
